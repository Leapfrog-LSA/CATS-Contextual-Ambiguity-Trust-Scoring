# Feed-health audit — July 2026

Reproducible via [`research/feed_health_audit.py`](../research/feed_health_audit.py)
(read-only; issues the same GET the weekly collector does).

## Why

A dead feed silently drops its source from every collection and biases the
dataset. *Il Corriere della Sera* (label 85, MBFC High — a scarce Italian
high-reliability source) had never been collected because its registered feed
404s. That was found by chance; this audit finds the rest on purpose.

## Result (126 feeds in `data/labels.jsonl`)

| Status | At audit | After repair |
|---|---:|---:|
| ok | 64 | **91** |
| dead | 35 | **9** |
| not-xml | 10 | 10 |
| blocked | 17 | 16 |

At audit only **~51%** of registered feeds returned a feed — why ~59 sources
appear in the snapshots despite 126 registered feeds, and the loss was **not
random** (the dead feeds clustered at labels 85 and 50, biasing the effective
dataset). After the repair passes below, **~70%** work.

The dead feeds are overwhelmingly non-Italian international outlets whose feed
URLs have moved.

## Repair progress

**Every replacement checked for HTTP 200 + valid XML *and* correct
outlet/language** before applying. **28 feeds repaired** across three rounds
(35 dead → 9; ok 64 → 91, ≈72% working):

- **Round 1 (common-path probing, 14):** Corriere della Sera
  (`→ xml2.corriereobjects.it/rss/homepage.xml`), Il Giornale
  (`→ ilgiornale.it/feed.xml`), Mail & Guardian, Al Jazeera Arabic, Gulf News,
  Manila Bulletin, Göteborgs-Posten, Texas Tribune, Digi24, Le Soir,
  The Register, Index.hr, The Citizen, ZDNet.
- **Round 2 (homepage RSS-autodiscovery + verified known URLs, 10):**
  BioBio Chile, Hindu Business Line, Irish Examiner, **Le Parisien** (the
  correct French feed `feeds.leparisien.fr/leparisien/rss` — round 1 had only
  found its English edition, so it was skipped then), Welt, Sky News UK,
  Jerusalem Post, The Standard, Defense News, Firstpost.

- **Round 3 (WebSearch per source, 4):** Haaretz English
  (`→ haaretz.com/srv/all-headlines-rss`), Bild (`→ bild.de/feed/alles.xml`),
  The Conversation AU (`→ theconversation.com/au/articles.atom`), The National
  UAE (`→ thenationalnews.com/arc/outboundfeeds/rss/category/uae/…`).

**Deliberately skipped** where the only feed found was the wrong
edition/brand/section: AFP (every English path still serves French), WNYC
(serves sister-site Gothamist), Geo TV (only a Bollywood section feed),
Business Day (no working feed found), ITV News / USA Today (no valid feed).

Still broken (~9 dead + not-xml/blocked): outlets with no discoverable clean
feed or that block scraping — TRT Africa, Jakarta Globe, DPA, Mediazona,
L'Orient Today, Taiwan News, Iran International, Rudaw, Caixin, Jordan Times,
B92, SF Gate, and the like. These are the hard tail; some no longer publish a
usable public feed at all.

## Recommendation

Run a **feed-repair pass**: for each `dead`/`not-xml` entry, find the outlet's
current feed (verify HTTP 200 + XML), update both `data/labels.jsonl` and
`data/Fonti_OSINT.csv`, then re-run this audit until only genuine `blocked`
(UA/geo) entries remain. Drop sources whose outlet no longer publishes a feed.
This roughly **doubles** the usable source count before the next calibration —
a bigger, less biased dataset — and is a prerequisite for the ≥100-source
future-holdout target. It needs a network session; the audit tool makes it a
mechanical, verifiable loop. Do not auto-remove `blocked` feeds: they may just
refuse this User-Agent.
